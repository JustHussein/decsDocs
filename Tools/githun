- download GIT for local use from https://git-scm.com/
- after install i should config git (pick a username for myself) by these command:
```
- git config --global user.name "justhussein" 
- git config --global user.email "h.mirzaei.eng@gmail.com"
```
- git init:    creeate repository: repository is like a folder wich we store our code into  it. for create a repository i go to the directory in my local drive and run cmd and then create repo by this command: 
```
- git init 
```
after that, the directory will created with .git name 

- command   git status  show the state of your local repo
```
On branch master 
No commits yet 
Untracked files: 
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed) 
        site1/ 
        tamarin/ 
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```
i have 2 folder in this repo wiche untracked and should track them manualy.

- Stage:    track files by this command: prepare files to be commit
```
- git add site1
- git add tamrin
OR
- git add --a
```

- Commit:    after i staged(track) all file that i wanted, i should comittt them: commited file is like resore point for that file. whenever i change this file and it's be usless, i can use the commited point and restore it.
```
- git commit -m"init commit"
```
-m in above code mean message.

- after we modified a file we can trat in 2 ways:
	- git add file then git commit file
	- or git commit file
- in fact by git add i choose the files wich i wann commited. if i use commit all files will be satged(cached) to be commited.
